# spring-clojure-test-repl
Adds a Clojure REPL to Spring applications to support interactive bug hunting.

## Integration
To use, add the following snippet to your POM and **build** and **run** your Spring Boot application with profile
`test-repl`.
```xml
<profiles>
    <profile>
        <id>test-repl</id>
        <dependencies>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>de.sebhans.test</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-clojure-test-repl</artifactId>
                <version>1.2.0</version>
                <scope>runtime</scope>
                <classifier>include-clojars</classifier>
            </dependency>
        </dependencies>
    </profile>
</profiles>
```

Putting the dependency in a Maven profile ensures that the dependency on Clojure does not pollute any builds (test, production, dev) unless explicitly enabled during the Maven build.

When running a Spring Boot application, activate the Spring profile `test-repl` to automatically start a REPL listening on `localhost:7888`.
The port can be changed by setting the property `test.repl.port` to a different port.
The bind address can be changed by setting the property `test.repl.bind-address` to a different value.

For a Spring-only application (without Spring Boot), you need to create a Bean of type `de.sebhans.test.repl.REPLServer` yourself, passing the bind address and port as parameters to the constructor.

Since JDK 16, the following JDK options are required to make the reflection in Clojure work: `--add-exports=java.base/sun.nio.ch=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.lang.reflect=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.io=ALL-UNNAMED --add-exports=jdk.unsupported/sun.misc=ALL-UNNAMED`

## Usage

### Connecting to the REPL
Use your favorite nREPL client to connect to `localhost:7888`.
The only client which has been tested extensively (because I use it) is
[GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with [Monroe](https://github.com/sanel/monroe/).
You might also try the [Clojure-Kit](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8636-clojure-kit) IntelliJ plugin
or any client listed on the [nREPL Clients](https://nrepl.org/nrepl/usage/clients.html) web page.

Type Clojure code into the REPL and have fun.

### Available Functions
This project includes the following Clojure libraries.
* [nrepl 1.0.0](https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl) for provisioning of the nREPL
* [org.clojure/data.json 2.4.0](https://github.com/clojure/data.json) for JSON parsing and building
* [http-kit 2.6.0](https://github.com/http-kit/http-kit) for HTTP requests
* [enlive 1.1.6](https://github.com/cgrand/enlive) for HTML parsing

Access to the Spring application context is provided via the static method `REPLServer.getContext`,
which means you can access Spring beans from the REPL like this:
```clojure
; Import REPLServer class so its methods are available in the REPL:
(import '(de.sebhans.test.repl REPLServer))

; Define helper function to access beans:
(defn get-bean
  "Look up bean by name in the Spring application context"
  [name]
  (.getBean (REPLServer/getContext) name))

; Fetch a bean from the application context:
(def my-bean (get-bean "myBeanName"))

; Call a method on the bean
(.someMethod my-bean "these" "are" "the" "arguments")
```
